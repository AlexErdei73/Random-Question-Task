## Solution

I created two React components, the Question and Answer components. These are controlled components, which are children of the main App component in the \_app.js file. Both components use the question.js module in the utilities filder. This contains all the question specific information and logic, which needed to solve the problem.

## Bug fix

The original code contained a minor bug, which resulted in the following issue. When the user first types in his solution, she or he gets always incorrect answer mark (red cross) regardlessly if the result is correct. After reediting the answer and pressing the button again, he or she gets the right mark. I fixed this problem, please check the commit history for more details.

## Are React or Next the best tools for this problem?

Solving the problem strengthened my initial thoughts about this question. React is great if the UI is very complex with lot of interactivity. It can save the developer a lot of time with developing DOM manipulation logic. React itself is a tiny library, so it is usually very fast. The main disadvantage is that the DOM is generated by client-side JavaScript, so it is not optimal for search engines, which can only search in deployed HTML files currently instead of JavaScript code.

Next.js is mainly popular because it is capable for server side rendering. This makes the site content visible for search engines, which is crucial for popular e-commerce applications. Another reason is that the documentation of Next.js is excellent. These two thing made it a very popular React framework. Unfortunately my experience is that the technology behind Next.js is quite complex and it makes things slower than simply applying React on the client-side. I have seen it in several projects and this is the reason of that rumour that React apps are very slow and full of spinners. This may be particularly true for the free tier deployments. React apps are very fast, Next.js apps are slow in my oppinion.

In this case the complexities of the problem are not in the UI, therefore the application of React does not bring any advantage. The best tool would be to develop the site without any frontend library or framework in my opinion.

## Original Documentation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
